In most cases the js-controller will detect the new node version and tries to fix adapters which are having problems with the change. But in some other cases the &quot;recompiling&quot; will fail and you got some additional steps to do like described at the linked ioBroker forum post.</p><p>To avoid these problems when upgrading your ioBroker Docker container we recommend using the &quot;Backup and Restore&quot; procedure as &quot;best practice&quot; whenever switching an existing ioBroker Docker installation to a new major version.<br> This means it will be the best and less risky way to perform your upgrade with the following steps:</p><ol><li>Create a new ioBroker Backup</li><li>Create a new and empty folder for your ioBroker data</li><li>Copy the latest backup file from the old ioBroker data folder to the new one</li><li>Stop and delete your old container</li><li>Create a new ioBroker Docker container from the actual ioBroker image with the same configuration but mount the new ioBroker data folder</li><li>Start the new container and follow the process in the containers logs</li></ol><p>Now your ioBroker should be restored automatically and starts up the admin interface. After that it will automatically start to install missing adapters. You can watch the Process at the ioBroker Logs. When all Adapters are installed (this might take some time) you will be able to start your instances in the instances tab of the ioBroker admin interface.</p><h3 id="docker-healthcheck" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#docker-healthcheck" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Docker Healthcheck</h3><p>Since v5.1.0 the image contains a Docker healthcheck.
