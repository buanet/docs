As simply setting the needed ENVs won\'t migrate your existing states into the redis db (it would just start with an empty database) it is best practice to first run "iobroker setup custom" in your containers command line before adding the ENVs (your redis container should still be up and running). During the wizard you will configure your iobroker to connect to the redis db and get the choice to migrate your states into the new database. For more details how to configure ioBroker to connect to redis, please refer to the '),Qe={href:"https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Xe=(0,a.Uk)("official ioBroker documentation"),$e=(0,a.Uk)("."),et=(0,a._)("h2",{id:"miscellaneous",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,a._)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#miscellaneous","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,a.Uk)(" Miscellaneous")],-1),tt=(0,a._)("h3",{id:"beta-testing",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,a._)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#beta-testing","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,a.Uk)(" Beta testing")],-1),ot=(0,a.Uk)("If you want to get the newest features and changes feel free to use/ test the beta version of the Docker image.
