# Backup remote databases with iobroker.backitup

By default, the options for backing up remote databases are grayed out in iobroker.backitup settings when running inside a Docker container. This is made because backing up remote databases is not working "out of the box". This guide will give some information about how to make the settings available and what needs to be done to get the backup working.

## Prerequisites

To run a backup of external databases the container must fulfill some prerequisites. In some cases the prerequisites depend on the cpu architecture your Docker container is running on. To find out which architecture your ioBroker Docker container is running on take a look at the container log on startup. You will find something like this: 

```

-----                    arch:                x86_64                       -----
-----                    hostname:            iobroker                     -----
```

### Redis

::: warning Note
Restoring a remote redis database from iobroker.backitup ui is not supported! You have to restore the backup manually. For details see [iobroker.backitup docs](https://github.com/simatec/ioBroker.backitup/wiki/ioBroker.backitup-Wiki-English#redis-backup).

## Enable options in iobroker.backitup

To enable the greyed out checkboxes in iobroker.backitup settings you simply have to configure the environment variable `IOB_BACKITUP_EXTDB`and set it to `true`. For more information see [Environment variables (ENV)](/iobroker-docker-image/docs/#environment-variables-env).
