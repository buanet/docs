## Overview

I started this project in 2017 when I was looking for a clean and easy solution to run my ioBroker instance on my Synology DiskStation without virtualizing a whole operating system. Today this image is grown to the official Docker Image of ioBroker smarthome software.  

### What is ioBroker?

IoBroker is a open source IoT platform written in JavaScript that easily connects smarthome components from different manufactures. With the help of plugins (called: "adapters") ioBroker is able to communicate with a big variety of IoT hardware and services using different protocols and APIs.<br>
All data is stored in a central database that all adapters can access. With this it is very easy to build up logical connections, automation scripts and beautiful visualizations.<br>
For further details please check out [iobroker.net](https://www.iobroker.net).

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open source containerization platform that makes it easy to build, deploy and share applications in small containers. "Containerization" or "container virtualization" is the next step in virtualization technologies. While typical virtual machines use virtualized hardware to run a complete operating system, containers just include the absolute minimum of dependencies a software needs to run and directly share the kernel of the host system. Compared to virtual machines that saves a lot resources.
Containers also act as little sandboxes which adds an additional security layer and makes it easy to move them from one host to another.
For more information please check out the officials [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com) or take a small youtube break. There are tons of videos explaining what Docker is and how it works.

## Docs

## Tutorials

While the docs are kept general I made some Tutorials you can follow step-by-step to successfully set up your container.
