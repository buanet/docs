## Hi, my name is André.

Some people might know me as "buanet", but this in fact is just a domain name I publish my stuff at. ;)

I am a family dad and smarthome owner and work as a IT specialist at a german IT solutions provider. In my job I have a wide and diversified range of activities, such as consulting, administration, maintenance, support, development and technical teaching. In my spare time I am part of the OpenSource community of ioBroker and working on my projects. My main focus whithin the community is "smarthome with Docker". 

To get away from computer screens and all the nerdy IT stuff I like to spend my time with my family and friends doing some outdoor activities like hiking, biking and Geocaching. 

## This website

Looking for a way to **easily** provide all information, documentation and tutorials of my projects in **one place** I found this solution as a combination of my own domain, GitHub Pages and VuePress.

As my old solution with wordpress was eating a lot of time writing an managing it, I will now try to keep it as simple as possible.
